# Sewing company management app

I made a sewing company management because i lied to my teacher that i did an internship with a sewing company.

The app made using Next.js and pocketbase with other tools. see [package.json](package.json) file to see all the depenencys

# Runing Pocketbase db migrations

The [pb_migrations](pb_migrations) folder contain migrations scripts that will create all the collection necessary for the app to work.

Run `./pocketbase migrate`.

After that run `./pocketbase serve` to start pocketbase server.

# Installing Node dependencies

After starting pocketbase server run `npm i` to install all dependencies.

# Runing the app localy in developement mode

Run `npm run dev` to start next.js development server.

# Runing the app in production mode using docker
